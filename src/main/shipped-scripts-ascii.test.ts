/**
 * @file src/main/shipped-scripts-ascii.test.ts
 * @purpose Regression guard for ENC-1: every Windows script file we ship
 *   to user machines must be pure ASCII (no BOM, no byte > 0x7F).
 *
 * Background:
 *   Windows PowerShell 5.1 (powershell.exe, the built-in version that
 *   ships with Windows) reads .ps1 files using the *system ANSI code
 *   page* when no UTF-8 BOM is present. cmd.exe does the same for .bat
 *   with the OEM code page. On a Chinese-locale machine that is
 *   CP936/GBK; reading our UTF-8 multi-byte sequences as GBK mis-decodes
 *   them and can produce stray "}" / "{" / "'" tokens that break the
 *   parser at runtime.
 *
 *   Marina's shell detection (src/main/platform/windows.ts) prefers
 *   pwsh.exe (PowerShell 7, UTF-8 by default) but falls back to 5.1 when
 *   7 is not installed. v0.1.0-beta.1 shipped with Chinese comments in
 *   pwsh.ps1 and a user on Chinese Windows without pwsh 7 immediately
 *   saw a parse error at every session start. This test prevents the
 *   regression.
 *
 *   Adding a BOM would also work but forces every editor + tooling step
 *   (Write tool, prettier, electron-builder copy) to preserve it, which
 *   we cannot guarantee. Pure ASCII is the only stable rule.
 *
 * Scope:
 *   All Windows script files (.ps1 and .bat) under src/shell-hooks/ and
 *   scripts/ that get bundled into the installer via extraResources in
 *   electron-builder.yml. If you add a new .ps1 / .bat to that pipeline,
 *   add it to LOCALE_SENSITIVE_FILES below.
 *
 *   .sh / .fish files are out of scope — POSIX shells treat `#` comments
 *   as opaque until newline, so non-ASCII bytes in comments cannot
 *   produce syntax errors. They are still kept BOM-free for shebang
 *   correctness, but that is enforced separately.
 *
 * Fix when this test fails:
 *   - Replace Chinese / non-ASCII content with English (the canonical
 *     fix; matches every other shipped .ps1 in the project).
 *   - If you must surface a Chinese string to the user, return a stable
 *     English marker or exit code from the .ps1 and translate on the
 *     TypeScript side (main / renderer), where UTF-8 is unambiguous.
